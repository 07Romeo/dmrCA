# dmrCA

This codeplug was originally designed by ET-01 (silent key).  In the interest of taking his work forward as a memorial of one of his contributions I bring you the dmrCA code plug for the Anytone radios this will work on both Anytone AT-D878UV Plus & Anytone AT-D578UV Plus.

You can look in the install notes for recommended changes to this template to get it started for you area.  You can repurpose the 8d-Oakland area for your own primary areas local digital repeaters.  Anything that is a number unlabelled with a letter suffix is Digital, an "a" suffix is used on the areas number to show that these are analog repeaters.
